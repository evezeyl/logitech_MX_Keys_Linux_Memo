# logitech MX-Keys Linux Memo

This is my memo for using logitech MX keys and MX keys mini on linux (non mechanical), but I assume some of the information can be usefull also. 

The information for linux users is dispersed, and there is a lack of centralized information for linux users. 
Therefore I am trying to keep all what I found in one place:

- links where I found information
- reminders of keys shortcuts (we need that until it gets in the fingers) 

Feel free to suggest additions, add issues or push request.
I can't garanty that this will be done fast ... depending on workload. 

PS: I also use this repo for learning how to improve my skills (eg. building website with github and others).

Following (and thanks for this): <https://github.com/carlosperate/jekyll-theme-rtd>  for building the documentation
