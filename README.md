# logitech_MX_Keys_Linux_Memo

My memo for using logitech MX keys and MX keys mini on linux. 
Non mechanical, but I assume some of the information can be usefull also. 

I find it difficult to find information on how to use this fantastic keyboads.
Therefore I am trying to keep all in one place:

- links where I found information
- reminders of short cuts (we need that until it gets in the fingers) 

Feel free to suggest additions, add issues or push request.
I can't garanty that this will be done fast ... depending on workload. 


PS: I also use this repo for learning how to improve my skills (eg. building website with github and others).

Following (and thanks for this): <https://github.com/carlosperate/jekyll-theme-rtd>  for building the documentation
